tutorial week 6

-- Please sit with your group members. 

-- i want you to all close your eyes for a moment. 
	-- think about the mark that you want for the game project. 

	-- How might that mark relate to the execution of the game? Does the game work? Do people enjoy playing it? does it look good? 

	-- Think about how much time you think you can contribute to the game design, game artifact fabrication, and written component. 

	-- now think about your other responsibilities, other classes, your job if you have one, family commitments, leisure and rest, playing games, seeing friends. 

	-- Are you being realistic about the grade you envisioned at first? does it need to change? is it higher or lower than you first thought? 

	-- personally, i hold no judgement for what grade you want. What do i know about your lives, responsibilities, and aspirations?  For some of you, getting a C might be your goal.

	-- this exercise, in about two things, both relate to resposnibility. If I know what grade I want, and I've thought about why I want that grade and know how I can achieve that grade, then I'm being responsible. 

-- now i want you to turn to your group members, and one by one share the grade you thought of.
