'inevitability of objects' --  

Katharine norman, how the audience's imagination influences how they listen. 

	- multiscale sound composition (curtis roads)
		- formalism vs intuitionism -- emmerson and the mimetic proceses
		- sensation vs communication
		- deterministic versus stochastic algorithms
		- interaction with algorithms
		- what is a blank canvas?
		- fixed media vs live recording 

	- Kozel's 'closer'
		- the body is inherent to my methodology. jarvis: unable to conceive of his body being remoced from what he is thinking about. 
		- doing vs thinking: phenomenology (systems for jarvis, as a starting point)
		- harraway's 3+1 great wounds. 
		- craft and exploration
		- prereflexivity, methodology and heterophenomenologies
		- Barad: a body/object can not be an object of study AND apparatus of investigation (simultaneously)

		- connected to live coding: we carry the traces of tech with us. 
			- the digital technology leaves marks on us. 

live coding points to a disconnect between human input and gesture and what the sound is.

	mention to Kieran alex harker's dynamic dsp object, because you can specify the thread, and dynamically load more/less instances without stopping dsp. 


	sha xin wei: from technologies of representation to performance
	kozel: referencing deleuze/spinoza -- defining a body based on affect


	Jarvis says that for barad, questions of scale are important. 

	what is chronome?


	Ian on Doug's Instrumental Listening Paper: a 'transfer relationship' between imagining a sound, and then making an instrument that can play that sound, or work with that sound and manipulate it elsewhere
