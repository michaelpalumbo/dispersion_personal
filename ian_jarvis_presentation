'inevitability of objects' --  

Katharine norman, how the audience's imagination influences how they listen. 

	- multiscale sound composition (curtis roads)
		- formalism vs intuitionism -- emmerson and the mimetic proceses
		- sensation vs communication
		- deterministic versus stochastic algorithms
		- interaction with algorithms
		- what is a blank canvas?
		- fixed media vs live recording 

	- Kozel's 'closer'
		- the body is inherent to my methodology. jarvis: unable to conceive of his body being remoced from what he is thinking about. 
		- doing vs thinking: phenomenology (systems for jarvis, as a starting point)
		- harraway's 3+1 great wounds. 
		- craft and exploration
		- prereflexivity, methodology and heterophenomenologies
		- Barad: a body/object can not be an object of study AND apparatus of investigation (simultaneously)

		- connected to live coding: we carry the traces of tech with us. 
			- the digital technology leaves marks on us. 

live coding points to a disconnect between human input and gesture and what the sound is.

	mention to Kieran alex harker's dynamic dsp object, because you can specify the thread, and dynamically load more/less instances without stopping dsp. 


	sha xin wei: from technologies of representation to performance
	kozel: referencing deleuze/spinoza -- defining a body based on affect


	Jarvis says that for barad, questions of scale are important. 

	what is chronome?


	Ian on Doug's Instrumental Listening Paper: a 'transfer relationship' between imagining a sound, and then making an instrument that can play that sound, or work with that sound and manipulate it elsewhere

	- Kozel: stickiness, glitches, gaps, and the asymmetrical. For Jarvis, he hung on these ideas, and how the asymmetrical relates to 'expectations in the approach of the unknown'

	KEY TO JARVIS: "Barad's agential realism and the posthuman performativity"


	sharp peak between creating a fixed media piece and improvisation: 
		- what if a fixed media piece was created through improvisation? 
				- that the 'presentation' of the piece, that process(es) that take place AFTER one presses play. the body is not 

				-craft and instrumentality. the medium through which someone arrives at something. 

				- improvisation within craft: improvisation within design process? 

			-Jarvis, if you know exactly how 


	- Jacky: craft, where does failure fit into? sort of said one can't have craft without failure? 
		- improvisation is the choices you make continuously, not perhaps towards something, and how 


		1. I'm so glad you brought up Norman and how the audience's imagination influences how they listen. 
		2. you cited a difference in the gestures of a live coder and deadmaus: is it perhaps thinking about the imaginations of the audience, ancillary gestures vs performative?
		3. the cannonical complaint of laptopists performing checking their email. 

			- what deadmaus is gesturing towards, plays into the imaginations of the audience
			- live coders, gestures are more on the ancillary? 


			affectively influencing audiences. something that is completely outside of the world of sound itself. 



	"closing our eyes, and recognizing objectness in a diffuse way." (Doug)


	the piece at some level, including the instrument/machine and the enivronment IS THE PIECE< and the human performer comes in and disturbs that. (Doug)



the cursor is a gesture. (me)
